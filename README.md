# Smart-Clap
Smart Clap is a project designed to control electrical appliances in a home environment using Arduino Nano, sound sensor and a series of relays
The Arduino Nano will act as the main controller, receiving input from the sound sensor and then activating the relays in order to control the connected appliances. The sound sensor will detect clap sound, the Arduino Nano will be triggered to activate the relays accordingly. The relays will then be connected to the appliances, allowing them to be switched on or off based on the sound input from the sound sensor. This project could be used to automate various home functions such as turning on lights when someone enters a room and claps, or turning on the TV. The project could also be expanded to control other electrical appliances such as, air conditioners and more. With this project, you can easily  customize this project and automate your home and make it easier to manage.
